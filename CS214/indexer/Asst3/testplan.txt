1) testing invalid command line arguments

./index a add file1
result: invalid arguments
expected: invalid arguments

2). writing to file
./index test.json test.txt
result: writing to file..
	succeeded..
expected: writing to file..
	succeeded..

3) over writing
./index test.json test.txt
result: file already exists do you want to over write it? (y/n)
expected: file already exists do you want to over write it? (y/n)

Every test plan checks program behaviour in a special case to demonstrate all functionality.
